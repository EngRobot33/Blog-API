```
source venv/bin/activate
```
* After that, you must install all of the packages in `requirements.txt` file in project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create a `.env` file in root directory and add your created config:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key generated by https://djecrety.ir'
DEBUG = 'Project debug status'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ''
REDIS_LOCATION = ''
CELERY_BROKER_URL = ''
```
* After that, migration:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
